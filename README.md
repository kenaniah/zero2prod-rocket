# Zero To Production - With Rocket ðŸš€

[Zero to Production in Rust](https://zero2prod.com) is an opinionated introduction to backend development using Rust. This repository provides an alternate implementation using a different set of tools.

## What's Different?

| Original Tool | Alternate Used | Rationale |
| ------------- | -------------- | --------- |
| [Actix](https://actix.rs/) | [Rocket](https://rocket.rs) | Rocket can now run on stable Rust as of v0.5. Rocket requires less boilerplate and may be easier to use.
| [sqlx](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx) | [Diesel](https://diesel.rs/) | Diesel provides a query builder and an extensible ORM. Sqlx does not have these features. |
